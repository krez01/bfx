This is an official Blizzard API. View the [http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2626217/ World of Warcraft Community Platform API Forums] for more information and assistance. Currently, other than Realm Status, there are only plans for character profiles, guild profiles, arena team profiles and auction house data dumps.
